Plan for the presentation,


Presenting to investing, treat it like dragon's den.


Start




* Begin with a rhetorical situation
* Transition, “Don't wait for the future to get here, bring it with you”
* Hook about the product, grab the audience’s attention, showcase the product in the hook. 
* Transition, “What gang crazies could come up with such an ingenious idea?”
* About us, who are we, what we do, what is our company etc... 
* Transition, “How can you get it?”
* Business model, how we’re gonna sell our product, estimated projections, marketing, where you can get it, who the target audience is.
* Transition: “Currently the only way to “Unlock the Key” is on our website”
* Site tour, showcase our website, go over prices/models. 
* Transition: “blah blah blah”
* Mention Fake competitor group 7 (G.R.P7)
* Conclusion: “we are asking for a 90-100% final grade for 100% of our company, we hope we have your support”
