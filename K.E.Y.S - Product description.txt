Product Name - K.E.Y.S

Physical description
- Similar to an Apple watch
- Going in with a semi-realistic approach, like this technology is possible today.

How it works
- Basically like a virtual inventory where you can store items without taking up any space
- It has a volume limit, no weight limit
- No living things are allowed (Plants, animals, humans...)
- No stacking watches (You cant fill a watch with stuff and then put it in another watch)
- Items placed inside the watch are frozen in time, their attributes are always the same (put hot soup in, 2 hours later it will still be hot)
