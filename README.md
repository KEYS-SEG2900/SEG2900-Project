Product Name: K.E.Y.S <br />
Description: K.E.Y.S is a virtual storage that you can wear on your wrist.

Physical description:
- Similar to an Apple watch
- Going in with a semi-realistic approach, like this technology is possible today.

How it works:
- Basically like a virtual inventory where you can store items without taking up any space
- It has a volume limit, no weight limit
- No living things are allowed (Plants, animals, humans...)
- No stacking watches (You can't fill a watch with stuff and then put it in another watch)
- Items placed inside the watch are frozen in time, their attributes are always the same (put hot soup in, 2 hours later it will still be hot)

Multiple versions:
- v1.0 The base model, about the same amount of space as a shoe box
- v2.0 Upgraded version of the base model, Same amount of space as normal backpack
- v3.0 Same amount of space as a hiking backpack 
- v4.0 Premium version of the watch, Same amount of space as a shipping contaner
