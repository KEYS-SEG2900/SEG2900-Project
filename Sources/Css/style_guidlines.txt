Overall Look and Feel of KEYS
===============================

The overall look and feel should be modern. We will avoid 3D buttons and 3D metal looks.
The website will have our logo on top of every page on the left side. Our nav header will consist of a drop-down menu (left-hand side icon, drops: vertical column on the left-side of the website). 
We will have sharp corners, and contrast coloring in order to draw attention of the website visitors.

Colours
========
We chose the colours that would paint our modern product in very calming light. Our product is aimed towards convenience, so instead of emphasizing the chaotic high-tech nature of it, we took a more relaxed approach - relaying to the audience how much less stressful and less busy life will be with our product.

In order to complete that atmoshere, we decided to use the light blue to dark blue colour scheme. It includes colours such as the ones listed below:

- #91E5F6
- #84D2F6
- #59A5D8
- #386FA4
- #133C55

The use of whites and blacks (along with their variations in opacity) will also be used to contribute the professional look of the website, contrasting well with the blues.

Typography
==========
We will be using Poppins and Antic slab from Google Fonts. Important texts will either have a border or experience a slight style change (through the use of underlines, weight variety and italics).

Links
=====
Links will not be underlined and should change fill colour (not font, but the background fill colour) when a user hovers over one.
Links will not change color once pressed/used.

Buttons
=======
Our buttons will be flat and squared, Exception: Buy-Buttons will have raduis. 
Primary buttons -- back to top, navigation bar, next/before,...

Basic Layout Features
=====================
Every page will have:
- header (logo, navigation bar - links to other pages)
- footer (links to social media, copyright)
- fixed button (to get back to top)
- sections (mostly keeping them horizontal - 100% width; tables for comparisons, etc.)
- one slide show
- compareson table
