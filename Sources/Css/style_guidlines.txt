Overall Look and Feel of KEYS
===============================

The overall look and feel should be modern. We will avoid 3D buttons and 3D metal looks.
The website will have our logo on top of every page on the left side. Our nav header will consist of a drop-down menu (left-hand side icon, drops: vertical column on the left-side of the website). 
We will have sharp corners, and contrast coloring in order to draw attention of the website visitors.

Colours
========
We chose the colours that would paint our modern product in very calming light. Our product is aimed towards convenience, so instead of emphasizing the chaotic high-tech nature of it, we took a more relaxed approach - relaying to the audience how much less stressful and less busy life will be with our product.

In order to complete that atmoshere, the light blue to dark blue color scheme was decided upon. It includes colours such as the ones listed below:

- #91E5F6
- #84D2F6
- #59A5D8
- #386FA4
- #133C55

The use of whites and blacks (along with their variations in opacity) will also contribute the professional look of the website, contrasting well with the blues.

Typography
==========
We will be using Poppins and Antic slab from Google Fonts.

Links
=====
Links will not be underlined and should change color when a user hovers over it.

Buttons
=======
Our buttons will be flat and squared.
